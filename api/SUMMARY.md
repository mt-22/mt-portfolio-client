# Contact Form Implementation - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the contact form functionality for the portfolio website. The solution uses a Vercel serverless function with Resend to handle email delivery, following Vercel's function standards.

## Components

### 1. Serverless Function (`contact.ts`)
- Location: `/api/contact.ts`
- Exports individual HTTP method handlers (POST, GET, OPTIONS) following Vercel's recommended approach
- Handles POST requests for contact form submissions
- Sends two emails using Resend:
  - Notification to site owner
  - Confirmation to user
- Input validation and error handling
- Proper CORS handling with OPTIONS method
- Uses environment variables for configuration

### 2. Frontend Integration (`Contact.tsx`)
- Uses the new serverless function endpoint
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- reCAPTCHA integration with reset functionality

### 3. Testing
- Updated test suite in `/api/__tests__/contact.test.ts`
- Covers validation, error handling, and success cases
- Tests for all HTTP methods (POST, GET, OPTIONS)
- All tests passing

### 4. Documentation
- `README.md` - General information about the API
- `DEPLOYMENT_TODO.md` - Step-by-step deployment instructions

## Environment Variables
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key (required)
- `CONTACT_EMAIL` - Notification recipient (required)
- `FROM_EMAIL` - Sender address (optional, defaults to noreply@marshalltaylor.org)

## Benefits
- No need for external backend server
